This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native applications, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or complex state management.

```javascript
// Incorrect code that will cause the error

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null //Uninitialized state
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Accessing data before it's set */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
