## React Native Uninitialized State Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been properly initialized.

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access the `data` state variable within the `render` method before it has been populated by the asynchronous `fetch` call in `componentDidMount`. This results in a runtime error.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by using a conditional rendering approach that checks if the `data` state is available before rendering the dependent components.  This prevents the app from crashing while fetching data. 

This example illustrates the importance of carefully handling asynchronous operations and state initialization in React Native applications.
